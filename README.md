### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd school-management-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if available)
   - Configure database connection in `config/db.js`:
     ```javascript
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_PORT=5432
     DB_USER=your_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     DB_NAME=your_database_name
     ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   ```

5. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or for development with auto-reload
   npx nodemon app.js
   ```

6. **Frontend Setup**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser
   - Or serve the frontend using a local server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     python -m http.server 8000
     # or using Node.js
     npx http-server -p 8000
     ```
